## Cookie Monster Game
A simple 2D game in javascript. The player is controlling Cookie Monster to catch as
 many cookies as possible. Our Monster is moving on 10x10 grid and can not touch 
borders, which is ending the game. The player is controlling Cookie Monster using 
arrow keys.
Game has been created based on JavaScript constructors.
