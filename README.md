## Furry Game
A simple 2D game in javascript. The player is controlling Furry to catch as
 many coins as possible. Furry is moving on 10x10 grid and can not touch 
borders, which is ending the game. The player is controlling Furry using 
arrow keys.
Game has been created based on JavaScript constructors.
